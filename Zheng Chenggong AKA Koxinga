    <p>Zheng Chenggong (1624-1662) was a militarist and a national 

hero in the late Ming (1368-1644) and early Qing (1644-1911) 

dynasties.<br>
<br>
Zheng was born in a small Japanese coastal town. When his father 

was given an official position in maritime defense by the Ming 

court in 1630, Zheng was recalled to the ancestral home in Fujian 

province.<br>
<br>
In 1645, Emperor Longwu of the Southern Ming Dynasty (1644-1683) 

conferred the imperial surname, Zhu, upon Zheng Chenggong. Thus he 

was also commonly called Guoxingye (lord of the imperial surname), 

or its Hokkien honorific Koxinga.<br>
<br>
In 1646, Zheng led the Ming armies to resist the Manchu invaders of 

the Qing Dynasty. With Zheng's considerable strategic and 

organizational talents, he built a strong position on the Fujian 

coast and set military bases at Fujian's Kinmen and Xiamen.<br>
<br>
In 1659, Zheng launched his most ambitious military campaign, a 

maritime expedition with more than 100,000 troops up the Yangtze 

River. With large Qing forces still campaigning in the south, he 

achieved remarkable initial success, smashing through the lower 

Yangtze defenses to the gates of Nanjing, Jiangsu province. There, 

however, mistaken strategy and failure to heed his field 

commanders' advice led to a disastrous defeat.<br>
<br>
Forced back to his original base at Xiamen, Zheng was still 

unbeatable at sea. But the collapse of Ming resistance in the 

southwest and the Qing’s new policy of forced inland emigration of 

the coastal population put him in a dangerous position. In these 

circumstances he hit upon the plan of taking Taiwan from the Dutch 

as a secure rear base area.<br>
<br>
In 1661 he landed on Taiwan near the main Dutch stronghold at 

Anping (near present-day Tainan) with a force of more than 25,000 

men. After an eight-month siege, the Dutch garrison capitulated. 

However, a year after this success, Zheng died.<br>
<br>
During Zheng's lifetime, he fought against the Qing Dynasty, drove 

out the Dutch colonialists and recovered Taiwan as China’s 

territory. He was commemorated on both sides of the Taiwan 

Strait.</p>
